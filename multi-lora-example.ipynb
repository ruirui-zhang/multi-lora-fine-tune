However, there can be instances where the approximations cause a dip in performance, especially if the low-rank approximations aren't chosen carefully.\n","- Dependence on Hyperparameters: Much like other ML techniques, Lora-based strategies involve hyperparameters that need precise fine-tuning. Mistakes in this area can lead to subpar performance.\n","\n","\n","[ASPEN: Efficient LLM Model Fine-tune and Inference via Multi-Lora Optimization](https://github.com/TUDB-Labs/multi-lora-fine-tune#experiment-results) is an open-source framework for fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) using the efficient multiple LoRA/QLoRA methods. How Multi-lora improve upon LoRA-based approaches:\n","\n","- GPU Memory Conservation: Use one foundational model for multiple fine tuning process, significantly saving resources.\n","- Automatic Parameter Learning: Introducing automation in the learning process for hyperparameters during model fine-tuning can speed up the process and guarantee optimal model results.\n","- Early Stopping Mechanism: Implementing this approach ensures no overfitting occurs, and resources are utilized effectively. It stops training once the model's improvement becomes negligible."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"4aabedf3","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.004403,"end_time":"2023-10-24T23:20:56.631057","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-10-24T23:20:56.626654","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["## 1.
